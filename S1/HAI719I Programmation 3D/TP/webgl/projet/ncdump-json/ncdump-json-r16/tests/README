You need to have **python** installed on your system to run tests.

Use: ./run_tests.sh, you should see some output and the line **ERRORS: 0**.
Edit run_tests.sh and add as many files as you want:

```bash
# sources
src[1]=socib-buoy.nc
src[2]=sresa1b_ncar_ccsm3-example.nc
src[3]=your_file.nc # add your file here

# variable/s (for each source)
var[1]=AIRT,AIRP
var[2]=lon,lat
var[3]=variables_of_interest # comma-separated variables of interest
```
